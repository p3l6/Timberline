# Shipping

### We deliver all over the Southeast every week.
This means easy ordering because you get what you want when you want it.

### We ship on our own trucks with our own drivers.
This means easy scheduling because you don't have to wait for leased trucks or hired drivers.

### We carefully load your order onto racks.
This means easy unloading because you just unload the rack not the individual plants.

### Minimum Freight Charge: $250.00
Freight quoted on order.
